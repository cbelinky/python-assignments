## ASSIGNMENT INSTRUCTIONS
STAR Voting (Score Then Automatic Runoff) is an electoral system that was first proposed in 2014. Voters assign a score to each candidate in a race. The two candidates with the highest total scores advance to an automatic runoff. The winner of the automatic runoff is the candidate who received a higher score on the most ballots. You can learn more about STAR Voting at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STAR_voting (Links to an external site.) and at https://www.equal.vote/starvoting (Links to an external site.).
